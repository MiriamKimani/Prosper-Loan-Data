# Prosper loan data exploration
## by Miriam Kimani


## Dataset

> My dataset is on loans by Prosper and it has 113,937 entries and 81 Variables. I however did not use the data as it is. After some cleaning I remained with a dataset of 83,961 entries and 13 variables and this is the data that I worked with.


## Summary of Findings
> After exploring loan status, employment status, monthly income, prosper rating, listing category and amount of loan taken the following were my findings:
>- Rating D has most defaulted loans as well as completed ones but the completed ones are more.
>- Most loans are for debt consolidation.
>- Employed individuals have the highest ratings.
>- Most of the time, the defaulted credits are those taken for business and auto.
>- The top rated individuals are the ones with most defaulted loans.
>- Large loans are taken by people with top ratings.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> I've chosen plots thst show distribution of main variables.
> i.e:
>- Loan status.
>- monthly income.
>- Prosper rating.

> I want to tell the major predictors for default of loans and Prosper rating variables.
